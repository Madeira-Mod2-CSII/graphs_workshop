def bfs(network, source):
    '''
    Purpose: Perform a breadth-first search on network starting
    from the source.

    Parameters: 
        network - a graph adjacency list; dict
        source - the node in the network from which to start
        the BFS.

    Return Values: 
        distance - the distance from the source to any other node; dict

        a BFS run; dict

    Parameters:
        network - adjacency list for a graph; dict
        source - the node to start the BFS run
        dest - the node where the desired path will end

    Return Value: a list containing a path from soruce to

    Parameters:
        network - graph adjacency list; dict
        source - the node to start the BFS run
        dist - the desired distance of the nodes to be found.

    Return Value: A list of nodes with dist dist after a BFS run.; list

def is_connected(network):
    '''
    Purpose: To determine if a graph is connected. That is does
    there exist a path between any pair of nodes in network?

    Parameter:
        network - graph adjacency list; dict
    
    Return Value:
        True - the graph is connected
        False - the graph is not connected
