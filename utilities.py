def bfs(network, source):
    '''
    Purpose: Perform a breadth-first search on network starting
    from the source.

    Parameters: 
        network - a graph adjacency list; dict

        the BFS.

    Return Values:

        a BFS run; dict

        source - the node to start the BFS run
        dest - the node where the desired path will end

    Return Value: a list containing a path from soruce to

    Purpose: To return a list containing all nodes in the network
    that are dist distance from the source.

    Parameters:
        network - graph adjacency list; dict
        source - the node to start the BFS run
        dist - the desired distance of the nodes to be found.

    Return Value: A list of nodes with dist dist after a BFS run.; list

def is_connected(network):
